### User Story

This is an application for well-to-do furniture collector who does not want to deal with 
the hassle and inconsistency of sites like Craigslist. There is an authentication process
to chairShare that tries to ensure its members will be reliable and their products are in
great condition. This is for the new home-owner who wants high-end products without spending
thousands on brand new items. This is a no-pressure site--no deadlines, no bullshit--just
normal people talking to normal people.

### Walkthrough

A new user will complete the survey. If the user answers the correct amount of questions,
she will now be able to sign-up for the site. She can edit her user information any time. 
Once on the site, she can start looking for products that she is interested in. She can 
also start creating new posts and get rid of the furniture she no longer wants/needs. 
Her Watch List will have all of her favorite posts, but she can remove selected posts.
 

The application uses a SQL database and is deployed on Heroku.
